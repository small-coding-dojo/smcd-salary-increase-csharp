# Todo List

- Specify Test for the case where "EmployeeRepository".get doesn't return any Employees
- make actual a field in the test class
- remove single parameter constructor of EmployeeSalaryIncrease
  - how do we handle or prevent the case, that a repository is null?
- care about _ in naming of test methods -> consistent naming
- convert local variables to fields in tests

- michael and falk to check whether their mob tool is up-to-date
